# Travel-Coin-Generator
This innovative project falls under "fintech and tourism" and aims to encourage tourism in India by rewarding visitors with digital coins when they visit famous locations across the country!
🌐 Project Description:
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we developed a website that detects the user's location through GPS coordinates, generating coins based on the popularity of the tourist site they visit. Each location grants a one-time coin reward, ensuring that users can’t claim from the same place twice.
🔗 Redeeming Rewards:
Our website features a redemption system where users can redeem coins via a QR code, making the entire process seamless and digital. Coins can be scanned and redeemed for special tokens or rewards, adding a unique incentive for tourists to explore more places!
